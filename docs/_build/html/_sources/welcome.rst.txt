Pysics
=======

Welcome
=======
Pysics is an easy-to-use 3D physics engine that allows for developers to easily control how time passes. This includes slowing down, speeding up, and even reversing the flow of time (which allows for some pretty neat effects).

Objectives
==========

This documentation is intended to do three things:

 - Help you get started creating game physics with Pysics
 - Explain the basics of many mechanical physics principles 
 - Explain how to implement these physics principles

Getting Started
===============

To get started with Pysics, hop over to :doc:`basics`, which features and explanation of how pysics works and an example to get you started.

For more advanced examples, see the `examples on GitHub <https://github.com/seanmjohns/pysics/tree/master/examples>`_.
