# Documentation

The documentation for Pysics is not web hosted yet.

You can build the documentation to view it locally:
1. Install `python3-sphinx` (Python Documentation Generator) using your system package manager
2. After installing sphinx-doc, run the following commands to build and view the documentation:
```
cd docs
make html
open _build/html/index.html #Or open the html file another way, such as typing the file path into your browser
```
